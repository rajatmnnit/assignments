## Assignment One: Formal Problem Statement (*FPS*)

This assignment is to:

 - Develop an **Rmarkdown Template** for a *Formal Problem Statement* , and
 - Use that template to write a *Formal Problem Statement* for your class project.
   - Name it *formal-problem-statement.(md|html|pdf)* and place it in the 
    `01-formal-problem-statement` folder. 


To recieve credit, you must knit the **FPS** as HTML 
document. Submit it and your Rmarkdown template in this assignment folder 
and push those back to your fork of the assignments folder on github.
 
**Each** individual should develop their own RMarkdown template and use it to 
evaluate their own project. You should not submit identical *FPS*s for the 
team. However, you are encouraged to discuss this assignment with your 
teammates and classmates through the classes google group. 

As you work through writing of your *Formal Problem Statement*, you will likely
discover something that you left out of or something that willl cause you to 
want to reorganize your template. GREAT! Revise your template. Remember this 
template is an asset you are developing that you can use in your career.


### Notes

 * This is a formal business communication. Therefore, it should be written 
   clearly in English. You should proof read your *FPS*. It 
   should be free of grammar, spelling and punctuation errors.
   
 * Any submission that simply creates a list based on the **Background** 
   section will fail this assignments. Fail, as in, recieve no credit. There are
   no points for demonstrating laziness ever.
   
 * Some proposed class projects do not have a readily identified business 
   user. IF this is your case, you need to use your imagination and identify for 
   me the **who** and **why** this is being done. Go ahead, invent a company 
   and a manager and a product owner. Make reasonable calculations as to the
   benefits and risks, etc.

## Background

Communication between the various roles in the organization involved in a data
science project is crucial. There is no more important piece of that 
communictation than the *Formal Problem Statement* (*FPS*). The FPS serves a 
number of purposes. It:

 - Forces the technical manager to think through all aspects of the problem
 - Provides acknowledgement to the "business" that the technical staff 
   groks the intent and requirements of the business
 - Provides a quick win as it indicates to the business that the technical side 
   is invested in the success of the business
 - Serves as a discussion starter between technical and business interests 
   regarding some finer aspects of the problem
 - Lays out a framework for which data scientist can perform their work and
   understand what constitutes success
 - Provides a benchmark for evaluating project progess  
 - It communicates to future technical staff (and perhaps future you) why 
   certain decisions were made
 - It servers as documentation necessary for compliance, risk and organization


So what should be contained in the *FPS*?  A lot. It is probably easier to 
state what it should not contain. It should not contain any technical explanation 
of **how** the problem will be solved. The audience is a 
non-technical one so any detailed discussion of what technologies will be used, 
what modeling algorithms will be tried, what technical resources will be 
consumed and how the model will be deployed should be considered out-of-scope. 

The *FPS* **should** answer the **who**, **what**, **when** and 
**why**. It should:

 - Identify key roles: management, owners, stakeholders, users, SMEs, etc.
 - Clearly articulate **why** the project is being considered
 - Estimate benefits of the project 
   - Identify any non-quantifiable benefits associated with project 
 - Define what determines the project's success
   - Define a success metric for the project, a single quantifiable, unambiguous 
     metric, that will be used to determine if your project is a success. This is
     not just a technical metrics, but one use at the managerial level. This of
     this is how "the needle must move" by your solution
   - Define (very precisely) the performance/power of the model or analysis that 
     is necessary to achieve that success to achieve the success
 - Estimate Risks
   - What if the success metric is not met?
   - What if the model performance metric is not met?
 - Identify **who** the users of the model are and how the model will used 
   - Discuss what changes have to happen within the organization to deploy the model
   - Discuss risks to model deployment, (e.g. push-back by employees )
 - Propose a timeline for delivery of your project
   - **When** you will have preliminary results of model/analysis performance
   - **When** you need or expect to have determined whether the model performance 
   - How much time it will take to deploy the solutions.
   
In short, your *FPS* should provide an answer to all **non-technical** 
questions based on the information you have at the onset of a project. The 
*FPS* is liable to change over the course of development of a project.

One approach for developing your template that might work well is to 
start by revisiting the notes from the first lecture that identifies roles and 
thier responsibilities. Your *FPS* should provide the information the 
*data scientists* can provide to help the non-technical roles meet 
those responsibilities.  

The name, *Formal Problem Statement* is not an industry norm. It is something 
that stuck with our organization (Decision Patterns). Other groups may call 
this a *Work Statement*, *Model Requirements Document*, etc. Those who have 
done formal project management may feel tempted to call this either a *Functional Requirements Document* or a *Business Requirements Document*. I wouldn't 
necessarily argue with either claim, but do feel that it is something more 
that is especially suited for the empirical nature of data science. 
The *FRD* and *BRD* generally server as contracts of what will be accomplished.
The *FPS* simply states: "given what we know of the problem, we will try and 
we know we will succeed if/when ..."

You do not have to adopt the "Formal Problem Statement" name. You should adopt 
a name that is right for you and your oganization.
